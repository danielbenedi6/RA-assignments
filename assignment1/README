Execution
---------
The experiments have been designed with C++11. In order to execute the
experiments, it is needed to compile it first. It has been tested with
the GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection:
    g++ assignment1.cpp -o assignment1 -O3

Then to execute the darts' experiment:
    ./assignment1 1
It will ask using the standard input how many iterations are wanted to 
run. Similarly, using the number 2 as the argument it will run the
needles' experiment. It will generate two files: 'evolution.csv' and 
'points.csv'. The first one will have which is the ratio in each
iteration. The second file will have the point generated.

Generating graphs
-----------------
To generate the graphs, there is a python notebook designed to be
executed in a Google Colab environment. Firstly, the files generated
by the program have to be compressed in a tar file with the command:
    tar czf <experiment>.tar.gz evolution.csv points.csv
Being <experiment> 'darts' or 'needles' deppending which variant of
the experiment has been executed. Then, they have to be uploaded in 
the root of the Google Drive. After uploading both tar files to Google
Drive, the whole Python Notebook can be executed using Google Colab.
