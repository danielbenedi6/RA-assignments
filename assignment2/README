Execution
---------
The experiments have been designed with C++11. In order to execute the
experiments, it is needed to compile it first. It has been tested with
the GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection:
    g++ assignment2.cpp -o assignment2 -O3 -fopenmp

Then to execute the experiments:
    ./assignment2

Generating graphs
-----------------
To generate the graphs, firstly it is needed to preprocess the experiments
output with the c++ code "process.cpp". It had to be compiled with the same
compiler:
	g++ process.cpp -o process -O3
Then the executable must be located in the same place as the csv files. Then 
it has to be executed with:
	./process
It will generate some ".dat" files that has to be moved to the subfolder 
./plots/data After that, with the command "gnuplot <dem file>" every plot can
be generated. For instance:
	gnuplot quickselect_mean.dem
It is important to notice that the working directory for this command havs to 
be the folder plots
