Execution
---------
The experiments and data structure have been designed with C++11. In order to
execute the experiments, it is needed to compile it first. It has been tested
with the GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. A Makefile is available to compile
it with:
    make

Then to execute the experiments:
    ./bin/assignment3

Debugging
---------
The makefile has options to compile this executable in debug mode so the data
structures can be observed in console with a pretty print and a small case.
To do so, the line 31 must be commented, the line 32 must be uncommented and
then the command must be executed:
	make clean && make

Generating graphs
-----------------
To generate the graphs, firstly it is needed to preprocess the experiments
output with the c++ code "process.cpp". It had to be compiled with the same
compiler:
	make process
Then the executable must be located in the same place as the csv files. Then 
it has to be executed with:
	./bin/process
It will generate some ".dat" files in the subfolder ./plots/data that must 
exist before executing it. After that, with the command
	make plots
will generate every plot in the report and some 3D plots that weren't included.
